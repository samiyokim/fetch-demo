## Further Thoughts
- Caching API call results
- Scalability: Enable larger API calls
- Filter by more search options: locations, name, etc.

- API - REST vs GraphQL
- automation - CI/CD using Jenkins - build on deploy, test suite
- monitoring - DataDog
- testing - Vitest and React Testing Library for client
